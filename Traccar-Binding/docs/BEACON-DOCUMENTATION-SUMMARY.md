# Traccar Binding - BLE Beacon Feature Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive BLE beacon tracking documentation added to the OpenHAB Traccar binding. The beacon feature enables tracking of up to 4 Bluetooth Low Energy beacons (cargo, bags, assets) attached to vehicles equipped with Teltonika FMM920 or compatible BLE-capable GPS trackers.

## Problem Solved

**Critical Issue**: Teltonika FMM920 devices assign BLE beacons to tag1-4 **dynamically based on scan order**, causing beacon data to shuffle between channels randomly. This made automation and UI unreliable.

**Solution**: MAC address-based routing that maps each beacon's MAC address to a consistent channel slot, with automatic assignment for unconfigured beacons.

## Key Features Documented

### 1. MAC Address Routing

**Configuration**:
```openhab
Thing device motorcycle [
    deviceId=10,
    beacon1Mac="7cd9f413830b",
    beacon2Mac="7cd9f414d0d7",
    beacon3Mac="7cd9f4128704"
]
```

**How It Works**:
- With configuration: Beacons always route to configured slots
- Without configuration: First-discovered MACs auto-assign to available slots
- Prevents beacon data shuffling between channels
- Name channel clears to UNDEF when beacon has no name (prevents stale data)

### 2. Distance Calculation

**Formula**: `distance = 10 ^ ((txPower - RSSI) / (10 × pathLossExponent))`

**Configurable Parameters**:
- `beaconTxPower` (default: -59 dBm) - Check beacon specifications
- `beaconPathLoss` (default: 2.0) - Environment-specific:
  - 2.0 = free space (outdoor, motorcycle)
  - 2.5-3.0 = light obstacles (car interior)
  - 3.0-4.0 = heavy obstacles (buildings)

### 3. Channel Groups (Per Beacon)

Each of the 4 beacon slots provides:
- `beaconX-mac` - MAC address
- `beaconX-name` - Beacon name (from beacon or FMM920 config)
- `beaconX-rssi` - Signal strength (dBm)
- `beaconX-distance` - Calculated distance (meters)
- `beaconX-battery` - Battery voltage
- `beaconX-lowBattery` - Low battery flag
- `beaconX-temperature` - Temperature (if beacon supports)
- `beaconX-humidity` - Humidity (if beacon supports)

### 4. Real-World Use Cases

Documented with complete examples:

1. **Cargo Detachment Alert**
   - Triggers when beacon distance > 10m while vehicle moving > 5 km/h
   - Notifications via email/push

2. **Low Battery Warning**
   - Monitors all beacons
   - Alerts when voltage < 2.5V or lowBattery flag

3. **Temperature Monitoring**
   - High temperature alert (> 45°C)
   - Low temperature alert (< -10°C)
   - Useful for detecting cargo overheating

4. **Startup Cargo Check**
   - Verifies all expected beacons present when ignition ON
   - Lists missing beacons if count < expected

5. **Weak Signal Monitoring**
   - Periodic check (every 5 minutes)
   - Warns if RSSI < -80 dBm while moving

## Code Quality

All code examples include:
- ✅ Proper null/UNDEF checking
- ✅ Type-safe quantity handling
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Informative logging
- ✅ Comments explaining logic
- ✅ Copy-paste ready (no placeholders)

## Testing Documentation

### Verification Commands

**Log monitoring**:
```bash
# Watch beacon detection
tail -f /var/log/openhab/openhab.log | grep "Found tag.*with MAC"

# Watch routing decisions
tail -f /var/log/openhab/openhab.log | grep "Routing tag"

# Check configuration loading
grep "Configured beacon MAC" /var/log/openhab/openhab.log | tail -10
```

**Item state checking**:
```bash
# OpenHAB CLI
openhab> openhab:status Beacon1_Name
openhab> openhab:status Beacon1_Distance

# REST API
curl http://localhost:8080/rest/items/Beacon1_Name
```

**Debug logging**:
```
openhab> log:set DEBUG org.openhab.binding.traccar
```

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made

**TraccarDeviceHandler.java**:

1. **Added imports** (lines 18-19):
   - `java.util.HashMap`
   - `java.util.Map`

2. **Added field** (line 60):
   - `private final Map<String, Integer> macToBeaconSlot = new HashMap<>();`

3. **Modified connect()** (lines 112-119):
   - Calls `initializeMacMappingFromConfig()` to load MAC assignments

4. **Added initializeMacMappingFromConfig()** (lines 168-181):
   - Loads beacon1Mac through beacon4Mac from thing configuration
   - Populates macToBeaconSlot HashMap

5. **Added processBeaconsWithMacRouting()** (lines 610-650):
   - Routes tag1-4 to beacon1-4 based on MAC address
   - Falls back to findAvailableBeaconSlot() for unconfigured MACs
   - Calls updateBeaconData() for each routed beacon

6. **Added findAvailableBeaconSlot()** (lines 652-662):
   - Assigns unconfigured MACs to first available slot
   - Returns null if all 4 slots occupied

7. **Modified updateBeaconData()** (lines 710-715):
   - Clears name channel to UNDEF when beacon has no name
   - Prevents stale data from previous beacons

8. **Modified updatePositionChannels()**:
   - Replaced 4 fixed updateBeaconData() calls with single processBeaconsWithMacRouting()

**thing-types.xml**:

Added 4 beacon MAC configuration parameters:
- `beacon1Mac` through `beacon4Mac`
- Type: text
- Advanced: true
- Descriptions with example MACs

**traccar.things** (example):

```openhab
Thing traccar:device:gpsserver:866088075183606 "Springfield" (traccar:server:gpsserver) [
    deviceId=10,
    beacon1Mac="7cd9f413830b",
    beacon2Mac="7cd9f414d0d7",
    beacon3Mac="7cd9f4128704"
]
```

3. Update troubleshooting section if new issues discovered
4. Keep example configurations in sync with actual thing-types.xml
5. Test all code examples to ensure they work

### Documentation Links

Main README references the detailed guides:
```markdown
## Documentation

- **[BLE Beacon Quick Start](docs/beacon-quickstart.md)**
- **[Complete Beacon Example](docs/beacon-tracking-example.md)**
```

## Conclusion

The documentation provides three levels of detail to serve different user needs:

1. **README.md** - Complete reference for all beacon features
2. **beacon-tracking-example.md** - Detailed walkthrough with full working config
