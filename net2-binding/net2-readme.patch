+# Paxton Net2 Access Control Binding
+
+This binding integrates the Paxton Net2 Access Control system with openHAB. It communicates with the Net2 Local API over HTTPS and receives live events via the classic SignalR 2 transport.
+
+## Features
+- Door control (hold open / close)
+- Real-time door status events via SignalR
+- Last access user and timestamp per door
+- Multi-door support under a single bridge
+- OAuth2/JWT token handling with automatic refresh
+
+## Configuration Overview
+- Create a bridge (`net2server`) with hostname/IP, port (default 8443), username, password, clientId, TLS verification flag, and refresh interval.
+- Add child door things with `doorId` and optional `name`.
+- Channels per door: `status` (RO), `action` (RW), `lastAccessUser` (RO), `lastAccessTime` (RO).
+
+## Maintainer
+- Nanna Agesen (@Prinsessen) — Nanna@agesen.dk
+
+## Build
+```bash
+mvn clean install -pl :org.openhab.binding.net2
+```
+
+## Notes
+- This binding is not yet part of upstream openHAB add-ons. Use the standalone repo or this fork until upstreamed.
